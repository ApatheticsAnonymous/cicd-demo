### Pipeline As Code

> Teams are pushing for automation across their environments(testing), including their development infrastructure. Pipelines as code is defining the deployment pipeline through code instead of configuring a running CI/CD tool. LambdaCD, Drone, GoCD and Concourse are examples that allow usage of this technique. <sup>From [Thoughworks TechRadar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques/pipelines-as-code)</sup>

Jenkins approach is to have Groovy files, where most of the other players use yaml.
